      "1047870 Something Ate My Alien is a 2D, digging and puzzle platformer game where you take the role of the AI Antalasia, and control your little Alien blobs to explore the planets you visit! Your task is to dig through the ground of the different worlds and find all the items required by the pirate that is hijacking you. During the adventure on each planet you have to battle environmental dangers, fight off wildlife, solve secret puzzle chambers, and all this while surviving on a depleting oxygen supply and a threat far scarier than the local wildlife. Key Features Dig through the depths of 4 different planets and collect as much loot as possible. Solve puzzle chambers by pushing and pulling blocks to reveal secret treasures. Survive by finding oxygen recharge stations and dodging environmental obstacles. Fight the hostile flora and fauna with your choice of 6 specialized weapons. Upgrade and build your equipment by collecting items and energy. Find hidden relics and collect achievements. Engage in bigger battles with the scary huge threats guarding the hidden secrets. DIG Guide the Aliens to find all the resources the pirate demands, and any additional items you find you can use to build upgrades. Some planets are rich in gems, others in specific minerals, fossils, artefacts or gases. Collect as much as you can! SOLVE PUZZLES Each planet has an array of puzzle chambers that once solved reveals hidden treasures. Pull and push the blocks into the correct positions to get the tokens containing parts of the code you need to unlock new places and move your adventure forward. SURVIVE Your Aliens need to survive in the perilous environments while digging and exploring. Find oxygen recharge stations and beware of pools of corrosive, super heated or poisonous substances, falling rocks, slippery ice, toxic gases and open flames. FIGHT There are 6 unique weapons all with different mechanics to defend yourself against the abundant flora and fauna. Look out for charging animals, flying creatures, armoured beasts and be careful walking underneath hanging fungi. UPGRADE Use the items the pirate doesn't want to build new upgrades for the Aliens. What should you pick? Faster mining? Better guns? Bigger oxygen tanks? Longer lasting jet packs? Or perhaps something else to aid your Aliens while exploring the caves? THE BIGGER THREAT The same alien race that left behind a maze of locked teleporters and the hidden codes to unlock them also left behind something very dangerous to guard it all, a fail safe. This looming threat is continuous and the more chests you unlock, the more unsettling the threat becomes...\n",
      "598350 Aliens have invaded Earth and they're not the little green men of the movies. These thing are weird. Mechanical steam-powered shell creatures... Bipedal robots... Flying eyeballs drones... Can this all be real? This game is a 90's retro style game. The aim of each level is simple: Kill all the aliens - then find the exit. But each level has a twist. (Some literally). The story so far... It is the year 2099. Over a hundred years have passed since the Voyager space probe was launched into outer space with its message of peace. Then on Tuesday August 15 th 2089 we got a reply. A formation of seven spaceships each approximately the size of Hawaii descended into our upper atmosphere. Radio broadcasts were beamed to the ships from the leaders of the ten world superpowers. In the days that followed high ranking officials began disappearing apparently due to the alien presence. As a member of the Secret Intelligence Service for the United Nations you were ordered to keep guard on the President of the United Nations. One night a strange wormhole appeared and sucked the President through. Taking no thought for your own life you manage to jump through after her*... (*yes that's right. A woman president. Sounds unlikely right? But this is the year 2099 after all).\n",

Arcade style They came from another planet is a risk/reward based, arcade style shoot 'em up where you fight aliens by shooting at them (from your ears). Killing an alien results in falling stars that you collect to level up and get stronger. You can stretch your head to collect more stars, but beware, stretching makes you an easy target for the invading force. Stars also give you points. Points are useless but fun.

      "1021950 A Game Without Meaning. A Game Nobody Should Play. When the Darkness comes is a walking simulator whose glitchy and dark tale tries to illustrate the hardships of depression and anxiety through a variety of imaginary digital landscapes. A clock, a piano and a girl. What do they all mean? What is meaning, anyway? What has meaning? Do you have one? A path, a goal, something determined, pre-determined? A light to follow? Discover a world filled with loneliness and fear. A world where despair breathes and hope dies. A world about you, about us. A world about humanity and about life. Before Starting This Experience is NOT for everyone. This Experience explores themes such as depression, anxiety, verbal abuse, manipulative control, and suicide . This game could also potentially trigger epilepsy attacks. Seriously, do NOT play this Experience if you believe this might affect you in any way. The first Arc should take about one hour to complete. About the Experience This was the culmination of a self exploration into my own psyche. If it can help anyone else explore their own I am thankful for that, and if the game isn't to your liking I appreciate you taking the time to try it anyway. I won't be updating it anymore (safe for major bugs) since it was simply an outlet for my own creativity but enjoy it as it is. Controls Movement: WASD or arrow keys Interact: F Jump: Space Sprint: Shift There's a toggle to swap between AZERTY and QWERTY layouts in-game. This Experience might not be suitable for streaming audiences.\n",

      "801410 WARNING - This game deals with some controversial topics like depression and suicide. Not graphic in nature, but please be wary if you like to avoid such topics. Story Those who suffer from depression often find it hard to put into words what they deal with, those who have never had true depression don't understand it. Harder still is to notice someone suffering without them telling you, many find out only when it's too late. We all look back and think, 'Is there something I could have done?' If you look hard enough, you can find different choices, but only when you look back knowing what you know now. College, a fun time for some, a bad time for others. All have hopes and dreams, but some demons pull them down to a hole they can't climb out of. Life changes based on the smallest things, and those who suffer can sometimes see a light to help escape the darkness, or be forever wrapped in it. Features [4 unique endings.] [2 playable characters.] [Unique characters and areas to explore.] Small note with minor spoiler This is all based on my experiences on both sides of the isle. Almost no one is ever to blame for choices made by others, and this is not meant to say you could've done something different to stop bad things from happening. We can always look back and see we should've noticed or we could've done better, but without knowing exactly what is going on, we can't ever really know.\n",
